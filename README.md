## About Traffic Zone
This resource aims to allow players the ability to toggle an active AI speedzone upon command input, Those being **Stop**, **Slow**, and **Clear**. All of the code is open source and I encourage people to build upon it. I plan to update this resource in the future to hopefully add new features and stability fixes.
