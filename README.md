# -Five-M-Standalone-AI-Zone-Controller
A simple standalone AI speed zone resource.

By: Jacooob Version: 1.0

## Changelog
Nothing Of Intrest Yet.

## About Zone Controller:
This resource aims to allow players the ability to toggle an active AI speedzone upon command input, Those being **Stop**, **Slow**, and **Clear**. All of the code is open source and I encourage people to build upon it. I plan to update this resource in the future to hopefully add new features and stability fixes.

#### Important Note:
**This resource is client, but other players will still see the affect of your speedzone. Blips are not displayed server side as of yet meaning only you can see the radar blip.**

#### Disclaimer:
This resource is in the early stages, all code and formatting is subject to change.

## Installation:
1. Verify you have the latest version of the resource.
2. Place 'zonecntrl' in your **servers** **resources** folder.
3. Configure the [config.lua](https://github.com/BcusIcan/-Five-M-Standalone-AI-Zone-Controller/blob/main/AI%20Zone%20Controller/zonecntrl/config.lua) to your liking. 
4. start *'zonecntrl'* in your **Server.cfg**.
